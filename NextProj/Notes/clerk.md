clerk is used by us for the authentication 


1. create an account on the clerk and start your application 
2. then cpy paste the comand given under the home page 
3. we will import the clerk inside the layout.tsx and we will wrap all through this with <clerkProvider>
4. now on the home screeen on the documentation you will find the button for moving next and in the next step we will just get the siginup and sigin in code from the the official website of clerk
5. all the pages will be inside the `app folder`, bcz we are using the app router of next js and and here every folder is represnting a router 
   ```cmd
   sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx
   ```
   ```cmd
       app/
        ├── sign-in/     ----->   representing the route like /siginup
        │   └── [[...sign-in]]/  -----> deeper path matching 
        │       └── page.tsx     -----> actual code goes here 
   ```
   `[[...sigin-in ]]` This is a catch-all route segment with optional parameters:

    The [[...param]] syntax in Next.js means:

    “Match /sign-in and any sub-paths like /sign-in/foo, /sign-in/foo/bar, etc., but it’s optional.”

    This means it will match all the routes requests of route like :

    /sign-in

    /sign-in/a

    /sign-in/a/b

    /sign-in/anything/else/here etc etc 

### difference betweeen the [..] and [[..]]

```css
| Folder Name   | Matches `/docs`? | Matches `/docs/a`? | Matches `/docs/a/b`? | `params.slug` value               |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `[slug]`      | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No                 | `"a"`                             |
| `[...slug]`   | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes                | `["a"]` or `["a","b"]`            |
| `[[...slug]]` | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes                | `undefined` (at `/docs`) or array |
